# Admin Dashboard Setup Guide

## Overview

Your e-commerce site now has a fully functional admin dashboard with:
- Secure admin login
- Product management with homepage control
- Homepage manager to control what displays on the storefront
- Real-time sync between admin and front-end

## Accessing the Admin Dashboard

### Method 1: Direct Navigation
In your `App.tsx`, navigate to the admin by setting the page state:
```javascript
handleNavigate('admin-login')
```

### Method 2: URL-based (requires router)
Access via `/admin` route (you'll need to add React Router for this)

## Creating Your First Admin User

Since you're using Supabase Auth, you need to create an admin user:

### Step 1: Create Auth User
Run this in your Supabase SQL Editor:

```sql
-- This is just for creating the auth user
-- You'll need to use Supabase Auth signup first
```

### Step 2: Add Admin Profile

After creating a user through Supabase Auth, add them to admin_users:

```sql
INSERT INTO admin_users (id, email, full_name, role, is_active)
VALUES (
  'YOUR_USER_ID_FROM_SUPABASE_AUTH',
  'admin@example.com',
  'Admin Name',
  'super_admin',
  true
);
```

### Quick Setup (For Development)

1. **Create admin user via Supabase Dashboard:**
   - Go to Authentication ‚Üí Users ‚Üí Add User
   - Email: `admin@test.com`
   - Password: `admin123` (change this!)
   - Copy the User ID

2. **Add to admin_users table:**
```sql
INSERT INTO admin_users (id, email, full_name, role, is_active)
VALUES (
  'paste-user-id-here',
  'admin@test.com',
  'Test Admin',
  'super_admin',
  true
);
```
